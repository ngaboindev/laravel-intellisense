## Configuration

You don't have to do any configuration for the autocompletion stuff to work! 

The package help you generate an ide helper file by writing this command
```
Generate Ide Helper
```
Or you can use the package directly [laravel-ide-helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper)

For the extension to work you need to have the database working! Since we need the database to get the attributes.
